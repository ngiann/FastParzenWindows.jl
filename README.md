X. Wang, P. Tino, M. A. Fardal, S. Raychaudhury and A. Babul, "Fast parzen window density estimator," 2009 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2009, pp. 3267-3274, doi: 10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178637.

The algorithm presented in the paper has two versions called 'hard' and 'soft'. 
This repository implements only the 'soft' version.
